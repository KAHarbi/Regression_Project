project 2 : Linear Regression Project



## Background
In this project, we will use data from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) it is a Medical Cost Personal Datasets , dedicated to the price of treatment of various patients. the price of treatment depends on several factors: designation, form of clinic, town of residence, age then on. we've got no data on the diagnosis of patients. However, we have alternative information which will facilitate U.S.A. 


### Prediction
> * Our TARGET from this project is to build a linear regression model that predict insurance costs.


## Data Description 
a data set dedicated to the cost of treatment of different patients. The cost of treatment depends on many factors: diagnosis, type of clinic, city of residence, age and so on. We have no data on the diagnosis of patients.
